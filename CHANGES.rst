Version 2.0.2 (2018-01-22)
--------------------------

* Fixed adding pages when visiting the direct child admin URL
  (e.g. /admin/redirectnode/redirectnode/add/`` instead of ``/admin/fluent_pages/page/add/?ct_id=``)

* Fixed fetching page layouts on django-polymorphic_ 1.3 / 2.0.
* Fixed adding pages when visiting the direct child admin URL
  (e.g. /admin/redirectnode/redirectnode/add/`` instead of ``/admin/fluent_pages/page/add/?ct_id=``)


Version 1.1.3 (2017-11-22)

* Upgraded minimal *django-polymorphic-tree* version from 1.4 to to 1.4.1, to include a required bugfix.
* Fixed unwanted migrations created by Django 1.10+

  This also fixes the django-fluent-blogs_ admin page for the ``BlogPage`` model on Django 1.10.


Version 1.1 (2017-02-18)
------------------------

* Added ``child_types`` and ``can_be_root`` options to limit the allowed model types in the plugin.
  This allows limiting which child types can be used by plugins!
* Added support for ``{% appurl .. as varname %}``.
* Added ``ParentTranslationDoesNotExist`` exception to improve error handling
* Fixed Django 1.10 issue for the ``FluentPage`` type with an invalid default manager in the admin.
* Fix multiple fallback languages support in ``rebuild_page_tree``.
* Fixed migration string types for Python 3.
* Fixed using ``os.path.sep`` in ``FLUENT_PAGES_TEMPLATE_DIR``
* Fixed recursion bug in ``RedirectNodeAdmin``.
* Dropped Python 2.6 and Django 1.6 support

.. note::
    Creating child nodes in a language that doesn't yet exist for the parent node is no longer supported.

    While past versions tried to resolve such situation with fallback URLs,
    it turns out to be very prone to bugs when moving page brances or
    changing the translated parent slug slugs.


Version 1.0.1 (2016-08-07)
--------------------------

* Fixed bug that broke Django 1.7 support.
* Avoid installing django-mptt_ 0.8.5, which breaks pickling deferred querysets.


Version 1.0 (2016-08-07)
------------------------

This release provides compatibility with newer package versions.
Many fixes add to the stability of this release,
especially when extending it with custom page types.

Major features:

* Django 1.9 support.
* Django 1.10 support is underway (it awaits fixes in our dependencies)
* Support for multiple fallback languages.
* Nicer slug previews in the admin.
* Menu template improvements:

 * Added ``is_child_active`` variable to fix menu highlights.
 * Added ``draft`` and ``active`` CSS classses.

* The ``fluent_pages.pagetypes.textfile`` content can be translated.
* Old unmaintained languages can be redirected with the ``make_language_redirects`` command.
* Dropped Django 1.4, 1.5 and Python 3.2 support.
* **Backwards incompatible:** The ``FluentPageBase`` class is now removed, use ``AbstractFluentPage`` instead.

.. note::

    Make sure to add the ``slug_preview`` package to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

    django-mptt 0.8.5 has a bug that prevents pickling deferred querysets,
    hence this version is explicitly excluded as requirement.
    Use version 0.8.4 instead.


Changes in 1.0b3 (2016-05-17)
-----------------------------

* Dropped Django 1.5 support.
* Fixed displaying new empty translation page.
* Fixed page moving bug due to old caches on previous errors.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Improve error messages when URLs can't be created.
* Improve performance of ``PageSitemap`` for sites with a lot of pages.
* Temporary fix: Block moving pages to untranslated sub nodes, until a design decision can be made how to handle this.

* Fixed Django 1.8 issues in the "Change Page" view.
* Fixed migrations to prevent Django from creating additional ones when settings change.
* Fixed silent behavior of using ``.parent_site()`` too late in an already filtered queryset.

* Fix skipping mount-points in ``app_reverse()`` when the root is not translated.
* **Backwards incompatible** with previous beta releases: split the ``fluent_pages.integration.fluent_contents`` package.
  You'll need to import from the ``.models.``, ``.admin`` and ``.page_type_plugins`` explicitly.

Upgrade notices:
................

Due to Django 1.7 support, the following changes had to be made:

* ``fluent_pages.admin`` is renamed to ``fluent_pages.adminui``.
* South 1.0 is now required to run the migrations (or set ``SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES`` for all plugins).

Secondly, there were database changes to making the SEO-fields translatable.
Previously, the SEO fields were provided by abstract models, requiring projects to upgrade their apps too.

All translated SEO fields are now managed in a single table, which is under the control of this app.
Fortunately, this solves any future migration issues for changes in the ``HtmlPage`` model.

If your page types inherited from ``HtmlPage``, ``FluentContentsPage`` or it's old name ``FluentPage``,
you'll have to migrate the data of your apps one more time.
The bundled pagetypes have two migrations for this: ``move_seo_fields`` and ``remove_untranslatad_fields``.
The first migration moves all data to the ``HtmlPageTranslation`` table (manually added to the datamigration).
The second migration can simply by generated with ``./manage.py schemamigration <yourapp> --auto "remove_untranslatad_fields"``.

If you have overridden ``save_translation()`` in your models, make sure to check for ``translation.related_name``,
as both the base object and derived object translations are passed through this method now.

The ``SeoPageMixin`` from 0.9b1 was removed too, instead inherit directly from ``HtmlPage``.


Released in 0.9b2 (2014-06-28)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added Python 3 support!
* Added ``key`` field to allow linking to specific user-created pages (e.g. a Terms and Conditions page).
  This feature is only visible when ``FLUENT_PAGES_KEY_CHOICES`` is configured.
* Fix support for ``i18n_patterns()`` in the ``override_url`` field.
* Added ``hide_untranslated_menu_items`` setting in ``FLUENT_PAGES_LANGUAGES`` / ``PARLER_LANGUAGES``.
* Added ``page`` variable for menu items in ``PageNavigationNode``.
* Add "change Override URL permission" flag.
  South users: run ``manage.py syncdb --all`` to create the permission
* Fix resolving pages under their fallback language URL when a translated URL does exist.
* Fix exception in ``PageNavigationNode.has_children``.
* Fix moving pages in the admin list (changes were undone).
* Fix missing "ct_id" GET parmeter for Django 1.6 when filtering in the admin (due to the ``_changelist_filters`` parameter).
* Updated dependencies to their Python 3 compatible versions.
* Optimize queries for rendering menu's

 * nodes without children no need a query in ``PageNavigationNode.children``.
 * avoid polymorphic behavior for child menu nodes (unless the parent node was polymorphic).


Released in 0.9b1 (2014-04-14)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added multisite support.
* Added multilingual support, using django-parler_.
* Added hooks for patching the admin; ``FLUENT_PAGES_PARENT_ADMIN_MIXIN`` and ``FLUENT_PAGES_CHILD_ADMIN_MIXIN``.
  Note that using this feature is comparable to monkey-patching, and future compatibility can't be fully guanteed.
* Added "Can change Shared fields" permission for all page types.
* Added "Can change Page layout" permission for ``fluent_pages.pagetypes.fluentpage``.
* Allow ``formfield_overrides`` to contain field names too.
* API: added ``SeoPageMixin`` model with ``meta_title``, ``meta_keywords`` and ``meta_description`` fields.
* API: renamed ``FluentPageBase`` to ``AbstractFluentPage``.
* API: added ``get_view_response`` to the ``PageTypePlugin`` class, allow adding middleware to custom views.
* API: **Backwards incompatible:** when inheriting from the abstract ``HtmlPage`` model, your app needs a South migration.
* Fixed calling ``reverse()`` on the resolved page urls.
* Dropped Django 1.3 and 1.4 support.


Upgrade notices:
................

* When using custom page types that inherit from inherited from ``HtmlPage``, ``FluentPageBase`` or ``FluentContentsPage``,
  please add a South migration to your application to handle the updated fields.

 * The ``keywords`` field was renamed to ``meta_keywords``.
 * The ``description`` field was renamed to ``meta_description``.
 * The ``meta_title`` field was added.
 * The South ``rename_column`` function can be used in the migration::

     db.rename_column('your_model_table', 'keywords', 'meta_keywords')
     db.rename_column('your_model_table', 'description', 'meta_description')

* API: renamed ``FluentPageBase`` to ``FluentContentsPage``.
  The old name is still available.
