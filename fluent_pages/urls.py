# This urlpatterns acts as a catch-all, as there is no terminating slash in the pattern.
# This allows the pages to have any name, including file names such as /robots.txt
# Sadly, that circumvents the CommonMiddleware check whether a slash needs to be appended to a path.
# The APPEND_SLASH behavior is implemented in the CmsPageDispatcher so the standard behavior still works as expected.
