Using the example
=================

To run the example application, make sure you have the required packages installed.
You can do this using::

    mkvirtualenv fpdemo
    pip install -r requirements.txt

(This assumes you already have *virtualenv* and *virtualenvwrapper* installed).

Next, you can setup the Django instance using::

    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py loaddata welcome shop_example

And run it off course::

    ./manage.py runserver


Good luck!
